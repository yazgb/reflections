1.- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share it with other people. It will be useful when working in group on the same project.


2.- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I would like to pull changes manually to have control of the sate of my code. This way I would avoid having unexpected changes in my local repository.

3.- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is a copy of a repository that is created from Github servers to the same GitHub servers. So we create fors throug the GutHub webpage. On the other hand, a clone is a copy of a repository that is placed in a local repository. I think that a clone can be copied from a remote or from a local repository. A branch is created in a repository, so I create branches and add commmits to them in my repositories.

4.- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If a have an up-to-date copy stored locally and later, for some reason not have internet connection, I will still be able to work on my features and when ready merge my changes to the locally stored copy that has the most recent state.

5.- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would use another version control system like Google Drive to have an official repository in which I could keep the history of the changes of every file. However, it would be difficult when more than one person needs to work on the same part of a file. Also, the integration of the changes of every collaborator would require more time and effort, and I would be worried of the integrity of the files.
