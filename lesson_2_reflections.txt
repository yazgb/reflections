1.- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a new repository linked to the directory where we used the git init command.
	We need to do it to create the .git hidden directory in which repository metadata is store.
	
2.- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
 Working directory has files that can be or not tracked.
 The staging area is a place where we can add files that we want to include in the reposittory throug a commit to it.
 The repository is the place were we have the history of files that we chose to be tracked for version control.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
